# Governance Resources

Welcome to Governance Resources.  Our goal is to help open communities adopt and maintain governance structures that work for them.

The project has two main content areas currently: an index of governance case studies, including individual project governance documents/constitutions, and an index of more general governance-related resources.  

We also have some content areas in the pipeline.  Please see the [content ideas](https://github.com/shaunagm/governance-resources/labels/content%20ideas) label in our issue tracker.

## Governance Case Studies Index

This index lists individual case studies describing how governance works for individual projects, along with how their current governance structures came to be.

To be included in this list, a project must have some form of explicit governance document which can be linked to.  Projects do _not_ have to be currently active, nor do they need to be software projects or "open" projects, though open projects are our focus overall.

You can contribute to the index in a few ways.  First, you can add stubs to the list below.  To do this, simply submit a PR, making sure to fill out all columns except the "full case study" link.

If you'd like to add a new project with a full case study, or add a full case study to an existing stub, you'll need to use the interview questions in the [case study guide](https://github.com/shaunagm/governance-resources/blob/master/case-study-guide.md) to generate your writeup.  You can do this for a project you're a part of, essentially interviewing yourself, or you can do this for a project you admire or are interested in.  Once you've done a writeup, you can submit it as a PR, and the community will review it and request edits.  (If you'd like to contribute by reviewing case studies, browse the [case study submissions](https://github.com/shaunagm/governance-resources/labels/case%20study%20submissions) label for open PRs.)

Please feel free to reach out to the community at any point in the process.  We're happy to answer questions, provide guidance, and cheer you on.  :)

## General Governance Resources

Below is a list of articles, conference talks, books, and other resources which address governance in open and/or technical communities.  Bolded resources are recommended by the community.  If you want a resource to be recommended, open an issue in the tracker with the label [recommended resource proposal](https://github.com/shaunagm/governance-resources/labels/recommended%20resource%20proposal) and explain why you recommend it.  If two or more community members agree through leaving a comment on the issue, the resource will be recommended.

# Case Study Guide

This document provides guidance for writing up governance case studies.  A case study has two elements: questions to the individual answers written below, and a short (2-5 paragraph) summary capturing the key elements of the project's governance.

Below are the questions that a case study should contain answers to.  If you obtain the answers to these questions by interviewing community members that are not you or by referencing documents, please include links and attribution, except in the case where an interviewee prefers to remain anonymous.

If you feel a question is unnecessary, or if you'd like to add additional questions, please open up an issue with the [case study questions](https://github.com/shaunagm/governance-resources/labels/case%20study%20questions) so they can be debated.  We may decide to include some questions as optional.

## Current governance process

- What people have "leadership" positions?
- How do they get those positions?  (ie are they voted in, appointed, self-nominated, randomly chosen, etc)
- How are regular decisions made?
- How are controversial decisions made?
- Is there a voting mechanism? how does it work? how often do votes actually happen?
- Is there a veto mechanism? how often was it actually used
- How do you decide who is part of the community?  
- Can community members get special statuses and if so, how?
- Can community members be suspended or banned from the community, or otherwise disciplined, and if so, how?

## History and Context

- Has the project always had this governance structure?  
- What were the previous governance structures?
- What precipitated the change to your current structure?
- Do you anticipate further changes to your governance process in the near future?
- What pain points is your governance process prone to?  What needs to be fixed?
- What do you think the governance process does really well?
- What particular values does your community care about, and do you think the governance process reflects that?
- How often does the community explicitly talk about the the project's governance?
- Where do you hold discussions? (GitHub, mailing lists, face-to-face meetings, and so on)
- Who has access to those discussion channels?
- How is this access granted/revoked?
- Who moderates those discussions?

## Domain-Specific Questions: Software Projects

- How do you decide when a release happens and what goes into it?
- How do you decide who gets commit access?
- Do you have a RFC/PEP-like process?

Many thanks to Python's [open source governance survey](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8002/#annex-1-template-questions) from which we have shamelessly stolen a number of questions.
